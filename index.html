		<h1>SimSearch: an IGB plugin to identify and compare occurrences
			of (epi)genomics feature patterns in multiple genome browser tracks.</h1>
		<p>SimSearch is a pattern-search algorithm that provides
			biologists with the ability, once they identify an interesting
			genomic pattern, to look for similar occurrences in the data, thus
			facilitating genomic data access and use. For example, such patterns
			can describe gene expression regulatory DNA areas including
			heterogeneous (epi)genomic features (e.g. histone modification and/or
			different transcription factor binding regions). It is possible to
			define complex patterns based on perfect matches in genome tracks
			(regions that must match), partial matches (regions that are allowed
			to be absent), and negative matches (for instance to search for
			regions distant from transcription start sites).</p>
		<p>The SimSearch algorithm has been developed for the <a href="http://gendata.weebly.com/">GenData
			project</a> as a collaboration between
			University of Bologna and Politecnico di Milano. The SimSearch App
			for IGB is developped by @arnaudceol for the Istituto Italiano di
			Tecnologia.</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>

		<h3>Install the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB)</h3>
		<p>The SimSearch App is a plugin for the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB)
		that can be downloaded from <a href="http://bioviz.org/igb/">http://bioviz.org/igb/</a>;</p>

		<h3>Add the GenData repository:</h3>
		<p>From IGB, go to the “<b>plug-ins</b>” tab and launch the app manager. Add
		the GenData repository: press the “<b>add</b>” button, and insert
		“<b>SimSearch</b>” for name, and the url:
		<b>https://arnaudceol.github.io/simsearch/plugins/</b>. Then select the
		SimSearch plugin and press “<b>install</b>”. A new tab will appear in the
		tab panel in IGB.</p>

		<h3>Add the SimSearch Quickload server</h3>
		<p>In order to make it easy to test the SimSearch app, we have compiled a
		Quickload repository with public data (mostly from ENCODE and Roadmap
		projects) for the human hg19 genome. To access this repository go to
		"<b>data access</b>", "<b>configure</b>", "<b>add...</b>", and add the
		repository: name: "<b>SimSearch</b>" url:
		"<b>http://cru.genomics.iit.it/simsearch-quickload/</b>" Remember to
		select species "<b>Homo sapiens</b>", version "<b>H_sapiens_Feb_2009</b>" in
		order to see the datasets.</p>
