# SimSearch: an IGB plugin to identify and compare occurrences of (epi)genomics feature patterns in multiple genome browser tracks. 

SimSearch is a pattern-search algorithm that provides biologists   with   the   ability,   once   they   identify   an   interesting genomic  pattern,  to  look  for  similar  occurrences  in  the  data,  thus
facilitating   genomic   data   access   and   use.   For   example,   such patterns   can   describe   gene   expression   regulatory   DNA   areas including   heterogeneous   (epi)genomic   features   (e.g.   histone modification and/or different transcription factor binding regions). It is possible to define complex patterns based on perfect matches in  genome  tracks  (regions  that  must  match),  partial  matches (regions that are allowed to be absent), and negative matches (for instance  to  search  for  regions  distant  from  transcription  start sites).
